A game of Snake where the snake is controlled using AI to maximize wins. The AI is built using Q-learning. There is a graphical representation of the game
that shows how the AI makes decisions per state. The player can also choose to play the game regulary.

(Have not implemented AI functionality yet. Only created the basic game of snake of which the player can manually play)
